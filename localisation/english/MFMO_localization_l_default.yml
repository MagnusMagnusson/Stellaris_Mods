mfmo_START_SCREEN_RAIDING_CLANS: "For centuries our civilization has been a haphazard collection of warrior tribes. Endlessly we've bickered over honor, strength, and pride. As we inched closer to interstellar travel we've grown more unified, but only to the point an endless upbringing of war can bring disjoint groups of warriors. Now, with us on the verge of unprecedented galactic expansion, our three tribes set up our base on neighbouring stars, and together face this brave new world, filled with the oppertunity to show the might of our combined tribes to all who oppose us!"

mfmo_origin_archimedes_desc: "No later had this civilization started reaching for the stars before stumbling upon a strange neighbour: A planet-wide computer who was more than willing to share its findings! As the years passed this unlikely friendship benefitted both members, culminating in a formal alliance where this civilization and the machine intelligence set off together to discover what this galaxy has to hold.

mfmo_origin_archimedes_npc: "Archimedes"
mfmo_START_SCREEN_ARCHIMEDES: "The many discoveries we've made over the years have unlocked for us a new era: but none have been as monumental as our discovery of §BArchimedes§. The planet spanning intelligence that lives in a neighbouring star system has propelled our research forwards by centuries, and in turn we've done what little we can to aid in its research and provide a foil to help it understand the world around it in a more efficient manner. Now, with our joint discovery of practical FTL travel it is time we take this relationship to new heights. As the leaders of our interstellar §HResearch Cooperative§ Archimedes expects us to be valiant partners in unlocking the secrets of the universe. The machine has done so much for us, it is but fair that we return the favor, and together we breach the void and discover this brave new galaxy. "
mfmo_origin_archimedes_npc_desc: "Nobody knows who build this planet wide computer or much about its construction: only that it was tasked with discovering the secrets of the universe and was named Archimedes.

mfmo_origin_strange_family_desc: "This civilization has, trough unexplainable and impossible means, created a home to alien species from all across the galaxy. It has done this despite the fact it has not met any of the civilizations these aliens come from, many of which have only just invented FTL travel themselves. Stranger yet this civilization doesn't even seem to notice this strange fact, either that or they don't mind the diversity."
